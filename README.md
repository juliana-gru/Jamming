# Jamming
Web app that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
This project is part of Codecademy's course 'Create a front-end app with React' and was built originally with ReactJS using class components. 
I've refactored the code to function components.

Deployed with Surge to: http://jammingwithspotify.surge.sh

User stories:
- Lets you link your spotify account
- Search spotify api for tracks, artists or albuns
- Lets you add and remove songs to a customized playlist
- Lets you rename the playlist
- Lets you save your playlist

Additional features I've added:
-Play previews of songs
-Executes a search when pressing 'Enter' on the search bar
